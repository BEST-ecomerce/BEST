# Abstract 

- The purpose of the project is to help students  with their eating diet as it helps in health and  to do so many productive activities on a daily basis.

- This project will help students set their easting habits and hopefully achieve their goals.


# Motivation:

- The motivation of the project has come from the rise of unbalanced diets and lack of information of what’s health to take in and what’s not.

- Hence the students will know what to take and what not to according to their preference.

- This will be possible because the website will also share ingredients on how to make the food stuffs.


# Problem formulation/objectives:
