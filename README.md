# Abstract 

- The purpose of the project is to help students  with their eating diet as it helps in health and  to do so many productive activities on a daily basis.

- This project will help students set their easting habits and hopefully achieve their goals.


# Motivation:

- The motivation of the project has come from the rise of unbalanced diets and lack of information of what’s health to take in and what’s not.

- Hence the students will know what to take and what not to according to their preference.

- This will be possible because the website will also share ingredients on how to make the food stuffs.


# Problem formulation/objectives:

- The objective is to show students there is more to health and eating habits.

- You never know small things like eating diets change peoples views towards new challenges in life hence completing them in a productive manner.


# Methodologies/planning of work:

- Our group consists of four members and we have planned to work together on this website which will cater to the students all over.

- The first step the student will log in or create an account to access everything on the website.

- Then he/she will be allowed to order anything available.

- I would have expanded this dialogue but I will explain it based on the data flow diagram on page 10.
